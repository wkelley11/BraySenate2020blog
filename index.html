  <h3> Week 2 </h3>
  <h4> Sunday, January 19 </h4>
  <p> 
    I got back to the house at 9:00am and had a quick turnaround before leaving to do a training at Avogadro’s, a bar about an hour and a half away in Fort Collins. This area is particularly important because it sits right between Districts 3 and 4, which are going to be the two toughest for Diana. However, Weld County in District 3 is one of the most fracked and most polluted areas of the state, so there is a solid group of residents dedicated to fighting fracking in their community. Those are the people we are hoping will help us collect signatures in 3 and 4. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    On the way out of Denver we stopped at the new Bernie 2020 headquarters for Colorado. They were having their grand opening party later that afternoon, so there was a lot of energy all around. The Bernie volunteer base is really strong in Colorado, so there is only one paid staffer for the entire state. Most of the people setting up for the party were “veterans” of the 2016 Primary. Some of them had been paid during that election, but were now counted on to volunteer to do the same work. One woman had recently been interviewed in a national Bernie ad. It was cool to see the dedication and efficiency of a large and experienced campaign team. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    We got to Fort Collins a few minutes before the start time to set up and talk with the woman who had organized it for us. The bar actually had a projector and some other media stuff for us to use, so that made some of the presentation a bit easier. The training drew a pretty eclectic mix of volunteers. From what I gathered, the organizer was a former doctor now trying to stop oil and gas companies from ruining the backyard of her retirement home. Another was a former Army recruiter and converted Republican now extremely invested in Bernie’s 2020 takeover (although Warren, despite a poor first impression, is not so bad). A third was a recently engaged signer who also taught music lessons and just doesn’t like influence of oil and gas companies. The training went pretty well. Everyone was quite optimistic, and each trainee left with multiple petition sections to begin circulating. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    The training in Fort Collins took care of lunch, and we had another to do that night during dinner time. We had about an hour at home before heading back out to do the second training. A friend of Diana’s was hosting the training in her house, and had invited a group of her friends who had worked on environmental campaigns in the past. It was nice to interact with an experienced group of signature gatherers, but many of them really just wanted to add their own 2 cents. Many of the rules governing the petitioning process are different for candidates than ballot initiatives, so we had to clear up the discrepancies. It got a little tedious getting through everyone’s personal “tips and tricks” spiel, but we all got through it in good humor. The host’s steady supply of wine did not hurt in that regard. Multiple people also donated generously to the campaign at the end as well. Another big bonus was that many of the petitioning veterans were already notaries public, and offered to notarize petitions for us as volunteers begin turing them in. That way, we can verify that the petitions are notarized correctly and don’t have to send people looking for a bank or post office that will notarize for them. 
  </p>
  
  <h4> Saturday, January 18 </h4>
  <p>
    This morning I walked from my friend’s place to the Capitol for the Denver Women’s March at 9:30am. It was supposedly lower turn out than in years past, but I thought there were a ton of people there! Following the march, there was an expo with a pretty diverse presence, from the Sierra Club to free trade jewelry tables. After that, we got lunch with a group of women all interested in getting involved with the campaign. They looked a lot like a bridge club, but they had bonded over women’s issues in the past years and now had a tradition of getting lunch as Maggiano’s, a fancy Italian restaurant near the Capitol, after every Women’s March in Denver. A few of them agreed to circulate petitions for us, so I got to do an abridged version of my training module for them after lunch.
  </p>
  <p>
    We came back to the house and I made some adjustments to the training, and tried to brainstorm a few options for keeping track of each volunteer’s progress with petitioning. It’s important to be able to communicate effectively with each person to provide support for them, while also monitoring how many signatures are coming in from each district so we know where to focus our resources.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Friday, January 17 </h4>
  
  <p>
    We skied all day on Friday, and I caught a 4:30pm train back to Denver. It had been snowing all day long, making the skiing incredible. Unfortunately, with the snow came some crazy winds, and we were stopped on the tracks for 6 hours because the wind (85mph+) was going to knock us off the tracks if we kept going. I got in to Denver around midnight, and spent the night with a friend who was visiting for the weekend.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Thursday, January 16 </h4>
  
  <p>
    Arend, the “WeedTuber” was set to begin filming his endorsement video for Diana today, so I sent him a resource document with contact info for a few people that he could interview, along with a description of pertenant policy positions and a sample script with which to plug her campaign.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have developed and identified numerous resources that we think would be helpful for petition circulators to have in the field, but there has been some debate on how to best package them in an easily accessible way. Chris originally hosted a few maps he made on a Github site, but Diana was worried that if we had them publically available, other candidates would also used them. Chris and I are both fans of open-sourcing any resources we create, but agreed that for the time it would be fine to limit access to the maps. To solve this, I made a page on the campaign website that required a login in order to view it. This is where we will put all of the maps and other useful things, and share the password with our volunteer circulators.
  </p>
  <p>
    This afternoon, I finalized the training module and did a dry-run of the training itself to get feedback from the rest of the volunteers. It went surprisingly well, and I received some really constructive advice. Everyone agreed that it would be important to incorporate some sort of activity for the trainees to practice actually collecting a signature from someone else before going out into the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Later in the day, we met with a woman named Lauren Petrie, who works for Colorado Rising and has done incredible work with other environmental groups in the past. In the past few election cycles, she has organized the collection of millions of signatures for a ton of different ballot initiatives. She gave us really helpful tips about how to organize volunteers, the best places to collect signatures, and shared some crazy stories about encounters with people from the oil and gas industry while campaigning against them. These included getting harassed by goons hired to literally stop her from petitioning, and setting up a sting to expose a contracted signature collecting company that had been bought out by oil and gas companies after agreeing to petition on behalf of her environmental organization.
  </p>
  <p>
    After meeting with Lauren, Chris and I drove to the airport to pick up his dad, who was coming to ski for the weekend. We drove up to Winter Park and I spend the night with them on the mountain.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Wednesday, January 15 </h4>
  
  <p>
    This morning was the official Major Party Candidate Petition Petition Circulation training at the Colorado Secretary of State’s office. A few of us campaign “staff” drove downtown to the S.o.S. office. Two new volunteers from U.C. Boulder had taken the bus down to meet us at the training. The training was extremely dry, but sufficiently informative to make it worth our while.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we got back to the house, Diana’s husband, Leigh, had made a wonderful lunch for all of the volunteers. After lunch, I got to work creating my own training module that we would use to train our volunteer petition collectors. While the Sec. of State’s training had covered most of the important information, it took over an hour and a half, and was pretty painful to sit through. I wanted to condense that down to less than 30 minutes, while adding even more content. Not only do we have to make sure that our volunteers understand the general rules and process, it’s important that they know all the tips and tricks that go into being an effective, efficient, and overall successful signature gatherer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we are holding trainings at all sorts of venues (libraries, bars, homes, etc.), I had to design a training that uses minimal materials. All I’m working with is a one-page handout and maybe a whiteboard.
  </p>
  <h4> Tuesday, January 14 </h4>
  <p>
    Tuesday was a relatively light day (i.e. no formal events or meetings to keep us at HQ), so we drove up to Copper Mt. on Monday night to spend the next day skiing. Chris had just turned 21 on Saturday, so we stopped at a liquor store to buy some beer on the way out of town. Despite showing the cashier both his liscense and passport (and beard), we could not convince him that Chris was, in fact, 21. After a 5 minute standoff, a manager came to the rescue and we hit the road up to the mountains, beer in hand.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Monday, January 13 </h4>
  <p>
    We began the week with a sit-down meeting with Diana and her campaign manager, Lauren. Lauren only works part-time on the campaign, so we spend the first few minutes updating her on what we had been working on for the second half of last week and over the weekend. We then got into the real purpose of the meeting; preparing for the petitioning process. The general idea is to create a pyramid-shaped structure of command and communication, starting with Diana at the top and extending down to the individual petition circulators and all of the registered voters that they are able to interact with. Each level of the pyramid has a decreasing level of involvement or investment in the campaign, but more and more people are involved as the levels decrease. Our hope is that this communication structure will effectively disperse the work across enough people that no one is too overwhelmed by their individual roles.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first step in creating this structure was organizing the thousands of contacts the campaign has collected over the past year and to create an accounting system to keep track of our interactions with them, and record their levels of interest in volunteering for the campaign so that we can effectively take advantage of our human resources. The next step (in quick succession) would be to actually contact all of these people.
  </p>
  
  <h3> Week 1 </h3>
  <h4> Friday, January 10 </h4>
  <p>
    Most weeks, Diana, a clinical psychologist, sees a patient on Friday mornings, so we don’t start work until about noon. She sees this patient in her house, so we had to clear out for the morning. Chris and I went to Red Rocks amphitheater to see the park and run up the stairs for exercise, apparently a prominent Denver bucket list activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we got back, Chris and I began preparing for a meeting that afternoon with a local YouTuber named Arend interested in making a video for the campaign. Arend, who makes videos about weed, was kicked off of YouTube a few years ago and started his own video hosting website called WeedTube, which now gets thousands of views on its videos. Another intern, Sophia, came at noon. She is a Colorado native, and is tapping into her personal network in Congressional District 5, which we anticipate will be difficult to get signatures in.
  </p>
  <p>
    Diana’s patient cancelled at the last minute, so she was able to go to the jail where the protesters from Thursday were being held. While there, Diana met the parents of a college student named Ezra who had been arrested, and was a fervent supporter of her campaign. Diana returned with another intern, Stephanie, who would be working on Diana’s blog for the next few weeks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The meeting with Arend went very well. He and his assistant, Ariana, were super excited to help out and offered a lot of resources for reaching out to people, both locally and online. I we can provide them with good content, they might be able to make Diana go viral.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent the rest of the day researching for Arend’s video and answering policy oriented questions from “Local Bernicrats,” a group that approves candidates who are politically aligned with many of the interests of Bernie Sanders. They then provide suggestions to Bernie supporters as to who they should be voting for down the ballot.
  </p>
  <h4> Thursday, January 9 </h4>
  <p>
    Today was the day of the actual climate rally in front of the Capitol. Governor Jared Polis was delivering his State of the State address to the legislature at 11:00am, so the activists, led by members of the Sunrise Movement, Colorado Rising, and Extinction Rebellion assembled outside at 9:30 to begin their protest. We stayed for about an hour, taking pictures with the group leaders and sizing up the scene. Diana had a speaking engagement midway through the planned protest, so we left early. On our way home, I submitted a sample of our petitioning form to the Secretary of State’s office for approval. Later in the day, we heard that protesters had moved inside the Statehouse and been arrested for disrupting the Governor’s speech. Thirty protesters were arrested, and each held with a $1,000 bail.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we got back to the headquarters, I began emailing various student groups on college campuses around the state, especially those that represented liberal population pockets in generally conservative congressional districts, to gather their support and access their networks to gain potential volunteers to help us canvas in those areas. I drafted a standardized email to send to groups like these, and customized if to send out to each individual group. Afterwards, I created a Facebook post that included our volunteer sign-up form that we could post in various private Facebook groups that Diana was a member of.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Wednesday, January 8 </h4>
  <p>
    Wednesday was the first day of the 2020 Spring legislative session. Diana believed there would be a climate protest in front of the Capitol building that morning, so we went to join in which the action groups that were planning to attend. The protest was actually scheduled for the next day, but there were still many groups outside the Capital. We spoke to a number of them and listened to the reasons that they were protesting. By the time we left, many were interested in Diana’s candidacy and platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we returned to the campaign headquarters, I prepared a series of Facebook posts aimed at gathering information from potential volunteers. I worked with Diana to hone in the best possible language for the posts, and published them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following that, I researched existing events that would be happening during the petition gathering period, to which we could send volunteers to collect signatures from the attendees, trying to find things hosted by organizations aligned with Diana’s platform and likely to attract registered Democrats.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Tuesday, January 7 </h4>
  <p>
    We began the day creating social media content that could be posted throughout the day. That morning, Colorado Rising, a statewide anti-fracking group, had released 6 potential ballot initiative that would limit fracking across the state. Diana was heavily involved in the decade long fight to limit fracking in Colorado, so much of the social media content was oriented around connecting Diana to that initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
    The rest of the day was spent researching the areas of each Congressional District that have high concentrations of registered Democrats, where we should be focusing our petitioning efforts.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night I staffed for Diana at a meeting of the Aurora County Democrats. She was invited to speak along with another Senate candidate. Upon arrival, we began networking with the Party members and getting sign-ups for the mailing list. While Diana was speaking, we circulated around the room, getting pictures of her addressing the crowd.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Monday, January 6th </h4>
  <p>
    We began work at 12:00pm, a late start because the morning was spend cleaning up from the event the night before. The day began with formal introductions between ourselves, Diana, and her Campaign Manager Lauren. Introductions were followed by a briefing on the campaign’s current situation and our overarching goals, and our tasks for the next few days.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next 2 hours were spent sending out thank you notes to donors and acquainting ourselves with the social media accounts that the campaign is using for outreach and publicity. From there, we created content to be posted across all forms of social media that day.
  </p>
  <p>
    I researched various mass texting platforms that the campaign could use to contact and coordinate volunteers and potential petition signers. Since the campaign does not have a huge fundraising apparatus, we have to focus on using alternative options for solving problems that larger campaigns can pay to solve.
  </p>
  
  <h4> Sunday, January 5 </h4>
  <p>
    I arrived in Denver last week to move into where we would be staying for the duration of the internship. We were slated to begin work on Monday, January 6th, but Diana was hosting a campaign function at her house on Sunday, so we got right into the thick of things.
  </p>
  <p>
    The event was styled as a holiday party for family, friends, and neighbors. While the event was clearly connected with her Senate campaign, Diana is somewhat against hardcore politicing and wanted instead to provide a space in which people could come together over their individual issues. She invited multiple other Democrats running for Office in 2020, both from other races and her own, and gave each time to speak. Chris, the other intern from Middlebury, and I were tasked with welcoming the guests and facilitating the logistical side of the party. The house has a pizza oven in the living room, so we had to help everyone make their own pizza. This allowed me to meet a ton of different people as they each came through the kitchen. While it was not fashioned as a fundraiser, the event still brought in donations from many who attended, and was a great opportunity to orient myself in the landscape of local Denver and Colorado politics.
