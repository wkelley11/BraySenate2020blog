## Week 3

### Sunday, January 26
Today there was a candidate forum being held by a Latinx group in Longmont, about an hour north of Denver.  Diana was speaking to a group of Postal Service workers in the morning, so we were going to meet her at the forum to staff the event.  We decided that either Chris or I should stay home to send emails and contact potential volunteers, while the other went to the forum.  I ended up going to the forum.  Chris sent me a call list, and I talked to a bunch of people in the car on the way up trying to get them to collect signatures with us.  This was the first forum to which all of the candidates had actually showed up, so it was a good chance for me to see what they were each about.  Additionally, there was a somewhat unique format to this forum that allowed each candidate to speak more than usual.  Instead of putting everyone on stage at the same time, each candidate was brought out alone and asked a series of random questions, some of them the same and others picked randomly from stack submitted by community members. 

It was incredible to see the discrepancy in political savvy that was on display between all of the candidates.  [Hickenlooper](https://www.hickenlooper.com/) has been a governor and mayor for the past 15 years.  [Romanoff](https://www.andrewromanoff.com/es/andrew-romanoff-para-el-senado/) was speaker of the Colorado House and a serial candidate in the same time.  Others, like Diana or [Trish Zornio](https://zornio2020.com/) don't have political backgrounds, but have a general schtick that they rely on (climate and "science," respectively).  The candidate who resonated particularly well with me was [Stephanie Rose Spaulding](https://stephanyforco.com/) , a pastor and professor of Women's and Ethnic Studies at UC Colorado Springs.  I don't think she was as captivating as I had seen her in the past, but I think her active position on a college campus allows her to use a vocabulary that I am really comfortable with and speak to issues that I directly witness.  I couldn't imagine any of the other candidates even stumbling upon a phrase like "systems of privilege and oppression" or referring to the labor of navigating a new culture.  Even though other candidates made the claim of understanding the next generation ("as a millenial myself..."), Spaulding seemed to understand the difficulties that exist for young people today better than the rest (she's relatively young herself, but could (and did) crack a joke about not wanting to give away her age).  

One thing I found interesting about the forum was the candidates different approaches to engaging the "Latinidad" of the audience.  Romanoff opened with a tear wrenching story about his time teaching English in post-revolutionary Nicaragua, and mixed about 5 words of Spanish into his last remark.  He had the most enthusiastic supporters in the audience, but they all appeared to be hardcore gringos.  Lorena Garcia, a latina herself who has spent years as an immigration activist, threw in a few words with an overdone accent, but probably said fewer things in Spanish than Romanoff.  Diana, I thought, had a difficult time drawing explicit connections between her focus on climate change and the Latin community in Colorado, even though Latinx people have essentially been targeted by oil and gas companies in order to increase fracking near residential areas (wealthier communities have prohibited fracking in their areas, while poorer group are often forced to take small payouts and then live with the health consequences associated with living in close proximity to oil wells and fracking sites).  A good number of people in the audience were listening to the whole thing through headphones as an interpreter translated the whole thing.  I was lucky enough to be standing right next to her, so I got a little lesson in real-time translation, which I consider to be somewhat of a magic trick.  One asshole (an old white dude) had the audacity to ask her to be quiet, because "I can hear your gibberish very clearly from where I'm sitting."  I was really hoping that at least one of the candidates would ask to address the audience entirely in Spanish.  I'm not very good at Spanish, but it's still a little painful when politicians spit out a few words to act like they're a part of the Latinx community.  More than 1/10 people in the U.S. and at least half of the audience at this event speak Spanish.  It seems like at least one of the 11 people who spoke today should have spoken in Spanish.

### Saturday, January 25

We got an early start to drive down to Colorado Springs today for a few different campaign activities.  First up was a podcast for Diana with Our Revolution, a nationwide progressive advocacy group with a chapter in CS.  They were going to be recording in a public library, and when we showed up there were a lot of homeless people waiting outside to used to enter when the library opened at 10:00am.  That really got Diana amped about libraries and all of the public services they provide.  Chris and I made a failed attempt to do some recruiting on the Colorado College campus while she was recording.  They had just started one of their Block periods, and seemingly no one was on campus for the weekend.  

Next up was a training at the Pueblo County Democratic headquarters.  One guy who showed up thought it was just a meet-and-greet with Diana, so he left after he realized there was a higher level of commitment.  Another girl, a CC student, had seen Diana speak at a forum in the Fall and showed up really excited to help out.  That was very encouraging.

At 2:00pm, we went over to the Town Hall to collect signatures and walk with the Women's March.  A lot of other candidates were also there, and there was sort of a turf war over signature collecting.  It was a beautiful day outside and there was a really positive mood coming from everyone participating in the March, but it was still an exhausting few hours for the Bray team. Diana seemed to be growing more and more frustrated as the March went on.  We got some insight into the situation as we drove home after it was over.  Early on in the race, Diana had proposed an alliance between two other progressive female candidates and herself.  The plan was to publically join together to fundraise and promote each other, trying to make a big splash on the national stage, winning attention from the media and drawing donations on behalf of their female alliance.  Then, whoever was polling the highest before the Primary would stay in the race, while the other two would drop out and support the highests poller, thereby solidifying the progressive vote and giving a small-time candidate the chance to compete with the establishment Dems.  One of the women had declined to join the alliance, saying it wasn't in her best interest to join with Diana.  Today, it was clear that the other two had paired up to support each other, leaving Diana on the sidelines.  She had been completely trapped by her own plan.

### Friday, January 24

We had to vacate the house at 10:00am because Diana's client was coming for their weekly appointment, so Chris and I decided to try our hands at signature collecting.  We put on our "Volunteer Circulator" badges and headed to the D.U. campus a few blocks from the house.  After about 30 minutes of floundering around looking for highly trafficked areas and being asked to leave various vicinities (culminating with Chris being escorted from the library to the closest sidewalk by two Campus Security officers), we found a great crosswalk that most people leaving class had to walk through to get to the library and dining hall.  Once we set up shop there, we found decent success for a while in between class periods.  After that dried up, we headed back to the house to start contacting any and everyone we could.  Even though collecting signatures didn't feel like a very rewarding process, Nathan Steele was totally right; in order to get signatures, you need to be asking for signatures.  24/7.

That night was the night of the Glitter Bong Bash.  Diana had gotten 6 tickets for interested family members and campaign staff.  Unfortunately, they weren't VIP tickets, which included $250 worth of weed samples and paraphernalia.  Despite missing out on that sweet deal, everyone was excited to go.  Diana was coming straight from another event, and her husband, Leigh, wanted to drive separately so he could leave whenever he wanted, "in case it wasn't [his] scene." As it turned out, and as everyone expected, it was 1000% his scene.  Chis and I picked up Maxine, another intern, and headed to the venue around 7:30 to get an early jump on signature collecting before the party picked up and we lost motivation to be on duty.

Given its name and description as, "THE ONLY LGBTQA+ CANNABIS PARTY IN THE NATION IN FULL SWING JANUARY 24TH," I expected the Glitter Bong Bash to be a rave-type party with few garments, lots of neon, and a bit more smoking than normal.  On the contrary, the Bash was super chilled out, with grungy house party vibes, held in an old warehouse-turned cannabis club with comfy couches, classic corner store snacks, and an open bar serving exclusively peach vodka (later supplemented by other stuff that I assume someone made an impromptu booze run for).  For the record, "chilled out" is relative descriptor: about 500 people cycled through over the course of the night.  

It was really painful to be walking around with a badge that said "Volunteer Circulator," asking people if they were registered Democrats.  Everyone was incredibly nice about it, but that's an unprecedented level of lame.  Being "that guy" at a party doesn't even begin to scrape the depths of low that being "Volunteer Circulator" at a party achieves.  That being said, the organizers were incredibly supportive, and made sure everyone knew to find us to sign for Diana if they were Democrats.  Eventually, we were able to ditch the clipboards and enjoy the party.

### Thursday, January 23

We skied that morning until around noon.  It had snowed about 6 inches on Wednesday night, and kept on snowing throughout the day.  Probably the most snow I've ever skied on.  It was incredible.  

That afternoon, we got back just in time for a meeting with "Nathan Steele," a political consultant who came to advise Diana on her petitioning strategy.  He was an intense-talking guy with a sporty fisherman meets frat kid look.  His main point was that at this stage in the game, we just have to get as many bodies on the street trying to get signatures for us as possible.  I definitely don't disagree.  Diana is still somewhat focused on trying to get endorsements and broaden her appeal, but that doesn't really help unless she is on the ballot, and that will only come with straight-up canvassing.

### Wednesday, January 22

WE WENT SKIING.  It was great.

### Tuesday, January 21

In the morning, I entered all of the new trainees into the accounting sheet I created and did some more formatting to keep our contact lists in order.  Chris and I then got to work putting together a training video that could be sent to volunteers who were unable to attend an in-person training.  Chris synthesized the training materials I had created into a nice "Khan Academy" style instructional video, and I wrote a script for him to follow with his surprisingly clear and effective radio voice.  

We then updated the website's "Petitioner Resource" page to include the video, and began contacting potential volunteers that could be trained via video.

Diana was approved as a Local Berniecrats candidate!  You can see her responses and the other Colorado Canidates on their [website](https://localberniecrats.com/colorado/candidates).

### Monday, January 20

The trainings over the weekend went pretty well, but it became clear that it would be difficult to keep track of all of the petition sections being sent out with whom.  We need to be able to check in with all of our circulators to check in on their progress in each of the districts, and it would be helpful to know how many sections each person has so that we can know when to collect them and when to send out more.  We also need to keep track of who is circulating each section so that we can report it to the Secretary of State's office when we submit all of the petitions.  

I decided to create a spreadsheet that would track the petitions in order, along with all of the personal information of the volunteers that each petition had been given to.  Another sheet automatically takes information from there to create a new document that we can turn in to the S.o.S.  As long as we stay on top of who we are giving the petitions out to, we shouldn't have any extra work to do before turning them in (besides proofing all 15,000+ signatures).

That night, there was another training hosted by a guy named Charles at a local Democratic county office just south of Denver.  It was attended by two other candidates running for office who were willing to petition on our behalf.  One was running for state office and the other trying to take Ken Buck's U.S. House seat in District 4.  Buck is an established incumbent and staunch Republican in a very red district.  The DCCC isn't giving Ike, the Democratic challenger, any support because they don't think there is much hope of him overturning the seat, but he's the perfect candidate to do it.  He's a 15 year Marine Vet. who was discharged due to active duty combat injuries.  He drives a huge truck and is really invested in helping farmers and oil and gas companies transition to a sustainable future.  His vocal chords were paralized when his car was blown up by a roadside bomb, and after retraining the one that still works, he has a pretty soothing drawl that makes everything he says pretty compelling.  

He's also one of only a few candidates in any Colorado race endorsed by the Local Berniecrats organization, which provides down-ballot voting suggestions for Bernie supporters.  I found him to be a really interesting combination of things, and just an all around chill dude to talk to.

If the party and a few people in politics lined up behind him, I think he'd have a good shot at beating Buck, who's glowing resume includes working under Dick Cheney investigating the Iran-Contra scandal and being the Tea Party candidate in Colorado's 2010 U.S. Senate race.  Unfortunately, Dem's are so un-optimistic that Ike doesn't even have any primary challengers.  Overall, it was a good training, and I can not truly say, "I like Ike" (his somewhat unfortunate slogan and direct rip off of Eisenhower (but hey, maybe Ike knows something about District 4 voters that I don't)). 


### SideNote: Awkward CCI Experience Post

I had to make a brief reflection post on the CCI's "Experiential Learning Lifecycle Hub," which you can view [here](http://experiencelifecycle.middcreate.net/virtual-postcard/u-s-senate-race-in-colorado/). 

## Week 2

### Sunday, January 19
I got back to the house at 9:00am and had a quick turnaround before leaving to do a training at Avogadro's, a bar about an hour and a half away in Fort Collins.  This area is particularly important because it sits right between Districts 3 and 4, which are going to be the two toughest for Diana.  However, Weld County in District 3 is one of the most fracked and most polluted areas of the state, so there is a solid group of residents dedicated to fighting fracking in their community.  Those are the people we are hoping will help us collect signatures in 3 and 4.  

On the way out of Denver we stopped at the new Bernie 2020 headquarters for Colorado.  They were having their grand opening party later that afternoon, so there was a lot of energy all around.  The Bernie volunteer base is really strong in Colorado, so there is only one paid staffer for the entire state.  Most of the people setting up for the party were "veterans" of the 2016 Primary.  Some of them had been paid during that election, but were now counted on to volunteer to do the same work.  One woman had recently been interviewed in a national Bernie ad.  It was cool to see the dedication and efficiency of a large and experienced campaign team.

We got to Fort Collins a few minutes before the start time to set up and talk with the woman who had organized it for us.  The bar actually had a projector and some other media stuff for us to use, so that made some of the presentation a bit easier.  The training drew a pretty eclectic mix of volunteers.   From what I gathered, the organizer was a former doctor now trying to stop oil and gas companies from ruining the backyard of her retirement home.  Another was a former Army recruiter and converted Republican now extremely invested in Bernie's 2020 takeover (although Warren, despite a poor first impression, is not so bad).  A third was a recently engaged signer who also taught music lessons and just doesn't like influence of oil and gas companies.  The training went pretty well.  Everyone was quite optimistic, and each trainee left with multiple petition sections to begin circulating.  

The training in Fort Collins took care of lunch, and we had another to do that night during dinner time.  We had about an hour at home before heading back out to do the second training.  A friend of Diana's was hosting the training in her house, and had invited a group of her friends who had worked on environmental campaigns in the past.  It was nice to interact with an experienced group of signature gatherers, but many of them really just wanted to add their own 2 cents.  Many of the rules governing the petitioning process are different for candidates than ballot initiatives, so we had to clear up the discrepancies.  It got a little tedious getting through everyone's personal "tips and tricks" spiel, but we all got through it in good humor.  The host's steady supply of wine did not hurt in that regard.  Multiple people also donated generously to the campaign at the end as well.  Another big bonus was that many of the petitioning veterans were already notaries public, and offered to notarize petitions for us as volunteers begin turing them in.  That way, we can verify that the petitions are notarized correctly and don't have to send people looking for a bank or post office that will notarize for them.


### Saturday, January 18
This morning I walked from my friend's place to the Capitol for the Denver Women's March at 9:30am.  It was supposedly lower turn out than in years past, but I thought there were a ton of people there!  Following the march, there was an expo with a pretty diverse presence, from the Sierra Club to free trade jewelry tables.  After that, we got lunch with a group of women all interested in getting involved with the campaign.  They looked a lot like a bridge club, but they had bonded over women's issues in the past years and now had a tradition of getting lunch as Maggiano's, a fancy Italian restaurant near the Capitol, after every Women's March in Denver.  A few of them agreed to circulate petitions for us, so I got to do an abridged version of my training module for them after lunch.  

We came back to the house and I made some adjustments to the training, and tried to brainstorm a few options for keeping track of each volunteer's progress with petitioning.  It's important to be able to communicate effectively with each person to provide support for them, while also monitoring how many signatures are coming in from each district so we know where to focus our resources.

### Friday, January 17
We skied all day on Friday, and I caught a 4:30pm train back to Denver.  It had been snowing all day long, making the skiing incredible.  Unfortunately, with the snow came some crazy winds, and we were stopped on the tracks for 6 hours because the wind (85mph+) was going to knock us off the tracks if we kept going.  I got in to Denver around midnight, and spent the night with a friend who was visiting for the weekend.

### Thursday, January 16
Arend, the "WeedTuber" was set to begin filming his endorsement video for Diana today, so I sent him a resource document with contact info for a few people that he could interview, along with a description of pertenant policy positions and a sample script with which to plug her campaign.

We have developed and identified numerous resources that we think would be helpful for petition circulators to have in the field, but there has been some debate on how to best package them in an easily accessible way.  Chris originally hosted a few maps he made on a Github site, but Diana was worried that if we had them publically available, other candidates would also used them.  Chris and I are both fans of open-sourcing any resources we create, but agreed that for the time it would be fine to limit access to the maps.  To solve this, I made a page on the campaign website that required a login in order to view it.  This is where we will put all of the maps and other useful things, and share the password with our volunteer circulators.

This afternoon, I finalized the training module and did a dry-run of the training itself to get feedback from the rest of the volunteers.  It went surprisingly well, and I received some really constructive advice.  Everyone agreed that it would be important to incorporate some sort of activity for the trainees to practice actually collecting a signature from someone else before going out into the field.  

Later in the day, we met with a woman named Lauren Petrie, who works for Colorado Rising and has done incredible work with other environmental groups in the past.  In the past few election cycles, she has organized the collection of millions of signatures for a ton of different ballot initiatives.  She gave us really helpful tips about how to organize volunteers, the best places to collect signatures, and shared some crazy stories about encounters with people from the oil and gas industry while campaigning against them.  These included getting harassed by goons hired to literally stop her from petitioning, and setting up a sting to expose a contracted signature collecting company that had been bought out by oil and gas companies after agreeing to petition on behalf of her environmental organization.

After meeting with Lauren, Chris and I drove to the airport to pick up his dad, who was coming to ski for the weekend.  We drove up to Winter Park and I spend the night with them on the mountain.  
  
### Wednesday, January 15
This morning was the official Major Party Candidate Petition Petition Circulation training at the Colorado Secretary of State's office.  A few of us campaign "staff" drove downtown to the S.o.S. office.  Two new volunteers from U.C. Boulder had taken the bus down to meet us at the training.  The training was extremely dry, but sufficiently informative to make it worth our while.  

When we got back to the house, Diana's husband, Leigh, had made a wonderful lunch for all of the volunteers.  After lunch, I got to work creating my own training module that we would use to train our volunteer petition collectors.  While the Sec. of State's training had covered most of the important information, it took over an hour and a half, and was pretty painful to sit through.  I wanted to condense that down to less than 30 minutes, while adding even more content.  Not only do we have to make sure that our volunteers understand the general rules and process, it's important that they know all the tips and tricks that go into being an effective, efficient, and overall successful signature gatherer.  

Since we are holding trainings at all sorts of venues (libraries, bars, homes, etc.), I had to design a training that uses minimal materials.  All I'm working with is a one-page handout and maybe a whiteboard.   

## Tuesday, January 14
Tuesday was a relatively light day (i.e. no formal events or meetings to keep us at HQ), so we drove up to Copper Mt. on Monday night to spend the next day skiing.  Chris had just turned 21 on Saturday, so we stopped at a liquor store to buy some beer on the way out of town.  Despite showing the cashier both his liscense and passport (and beard), we could not convince him that Chris was, in fact, 21. After a 5 minute standoff, a manager came to the rescue and we hit the road up to the mountains, beer in hand. 

### Monday, January 13
We began the week with a sit-down meeting with Diana and her campaign manager, Lauren.  Lauren only works part-time on the campaign, so we spend the first few minutes updating her on what we had been working on for the second half of last week and over the weekend.  We then got into the real purpose of the meeting; preparing for the petitioning process.  The general idea is to create a pyramid-shaped structure of command and communication, starting with Diana at the top and extending down to the individual petition circulators and all of the registered voters that they are able to interact with.  Each level of the pyramid has a decreasing level of involvement or investment in the campaign, but more and more people are involved as the levels decrease.  Our hope is that this communication structure will effectively disperse the work across enough people that no one is too overwhelmed by their individual roles.  

The first step in creating this structure was organizing the thousands of contacts the campaign has collected over the past year and to create an accounting system to keep track of our interactions with them, and record their levels of interest in volunteering for the campaign so that we can effectively take advantage of our human resources.  The next step (in quick succession) would be to actually contact all of these people.

## Week 1

### Friday, January 10
Most weeks, Diana, a clinical psychologist, sees a patient on Friday mornings, so we don't start work until about noon.  She sees this patient in her house, so we had to clear out for the morning.  Chris and I went to Red Rocks amphitheater to see the park and run up the stairs for exercise, apparently a prominent Denver bucket list activity.

When we got back, Chris and I began preparing for a meeting that afternoon with a local YouTuber named Arend interested in making a video for the campaign.  Arend, who makes videos about weed, was kicked off of YouTube a few years ago and started his own video hosting website called WeedTube, which now gets thousands of views on its videos.  Another intern, Sophia, came at noon.  She is a Colorado native, and is tapping into her personal network in Congressional District 5, which we anticipate will be difficult to get signatures in. 

Diana's patient cancelled at the last minute, so she was able to go to the jail where the protesters from Thursday were being held.  While there, Diana met the parents of a college student named Ezra who had been arrested, and was a fervent supporter of her campaign.  Diana returned with another intern, Stephanie, who would be working on Diana's blog for the next few weeks.  

The meeting with Arend went very well.  He and his assistant, Ariana, were super excited to help out and offered a lot of resources for reaching out to people, both locally and online.  I we can provide them with good content, they might be able to make Diana go viral.  

I spent the rest of the day researching for Arend's video and answering policy oriented questions from "Local Bernicrats," a group that approves candidates who are politically aligned with many of the interests of Bernie Sanders.  They then provide suggestions to Bernie supporters as to who they should be voting for down the ballot.


### Thursday, January 9
Today was the day of the actual climate rally in front of the Capitol.  Governor Jared Polis was delivering his State of the State address to the legislature at 11:00am, so the activists, led by members of the Sunrise Movement, Colorado Rising, and Extinction Rebellion assembled outside at 9:30 to begin their protest.  We stayed for about an hour, taking pictures with the group leaders and sizing up the scene.  Diana had a speaking engagement midway through the planned protest, so we left early.  On our way home, I submitted a sample of our petitioning form to the Secretary of State's office for approval.  Later in the day, we heard that protesters had moved inside the Statehouse and been arrested for disrupting the Governor's speech.  Thirty protesters were arrested, and each held with a $1,000 bail. 

When we got back to the headquarters, I began emailing various student groups on college campuses around the state, especially those that represented liberal population pockets in generally conservative congressional districts, to gather their support and access their networks to gain potential volunteers to help us canvas in those areas.  I drafted a standardized email to send to groups like these, and customized if to send out to each individual group.  Afterwards, I created a Facebook post that included our volunteer sign-up form that we could post in various private Facebook groups that Diana was a member of.  

### Wednesday, January 8
Wednesday was the first day of the 2020 Spring legislative session.  Diana believed there would be a climate protest in front of the Capitol building that morning, so we went to join in which the action groups that were planning to attend.  The protest was actually scheduled for the next day, but there were still many groups outside the Capital.  We spoke to a number of them and listened to the reasons that they were protesting.  By the time we left, many were interested in Diana's candidacy and platform.  

When we returned to the campaign headquarters, I prepared a series of Facebook posts aimed at gathering information from potential volunteers. I worked with Diana to hone in the best possible language for the posts, and published them.  
Following that, I researched existing events that would be happening during the petition gathering period, to which we could send volunteers to collect signatures from the attendees, trying to find things hosted by organizations aligned with Diana's platform and likely to attract registered Democrats.

### Tuesday, January 7
We began the day creating social media content that could be posted throughout the day.  That morning, Colorado Rising, a statewide anti-fracking group, had released 6 potential ballot initiative that would limit fracking across the state.  Diana was heavily involved in the decade long fight to limit fracking in Colorado, so much of the social media content was oriented around connecting Diana to that initiative.  

The rest of the day was spent researching the areas of each Congressional District that have high concentrations of registered Democrats, where we should be focusing our petitioning efforts.  

That night I staffed for Diana at a meeting of the Aurora County Democrats.  She was invited to speak along with another Senate candidate.  Upon arrival, we began networking with the Party members and getting sign-ups for the mailing list.  While Diana was speaking, we circulated around the room, getting pictures of her addressing the crowd.  

### Monday, January 6th
We began work at 12:00pm, a late start because the morning was spend cleaning up from the event the night before.  The day began with formal introductions between ourselves, Diana, and her Campaign Manager Lauren.  Introductions were followed by a briefing on the campaign's current situation and our overarching goals, and our tasks for the next few days. 

The next 2 hours were spent sending out thank you notes to donors and acquainting ourselves with the social media accounts that the campaign is using for outreach and publicity.  From there, we created content to be posted across all forms of social media that day.  

I researched various mass texting platforms that the campaign could use to contact and coordinate volunteers and potential petition signers.  Since the campaign does not have a huge fundraising apparatus, we have to focus on using alternative options for solving problems that larger campaigns can pay to solve. 

### Sunday, January 5
I arrived in Denver last week to move into where we would be staying for the duration of the internship.  We were slated to begin work on Monday, January 6th, but Diana was hosting a campaign function at her house on Sunday, so we got right into the thick of things.  

The event was styled as a holiday party for family, friends, and neighbors.  While the event was clearly connected with her Senate campaign, Diana is somewhat against hardcore politicing and wanted instead to provide a space in which people could come together over their individual issues.  She invited multiple other Democrats running for Office in 2020, both from other races and her own, and gave each time to speak.  Chris, the other intern from Middlebury, and I were tasked with welcoming the guests and facilitating the logistical side of the party.  The house has a pizza oven in the living room, so we had to help everyone make their own pizza.  This allowed me to meet a ton of different people as they each came through the kitchen.  While it was not fashioned as a fundraiser, the event still brought in donations from many who attended, and was a great opportunity to orient myself in the landscape of local Denver and Colorado politics.
