# Diana Bray for U.S. Senate Blog
My name is William Kelley. I am a Junior Computer Science major at Middlebury College, currently iterning 
for Diana Bray's U.S. Senatte Race in Colorado.  In this blog, I will detail my experience working on the
campaign and living in Denver for the month of January.

## Week 1

### Friday, January 10
Most weeks, Diana, a clinical psychologist, sees a patient on Friday mornings, so we don't start work until about noon.  She sees this patient in her house, so we had to clear out for the morning.  Chris and I went to Red Rocks amphitheater to see the park and run up the stairs for exercise, apparently a prominent Denver bucket list activity.

When we got back, Chris and I began preparing for a meeting that afternoon with a local YouTuber named Arend interested in making a video for the campaign.  Arend, who makes videos about weed, was kicked off of YouTube a few years ago and started his own video hosting website called WeedTube, which now gets thousands of views on its videos.  Another intern, Sophia, came at noon.  She is a Colorado native, and is tapping into her personal network in Congressional District 5, which we anticipate will be difficult to get signatures in. 

Diana's patient cancelled at the last minute, so she was able to go to the jail where the protesters from Thursday were being held.  While there, Diana met the parents of a college student named Ezra who had been arrested, and was a fervent supporter of her campaign.  Diana returned with another intern, Stephanie, who would be working on Diana's blog for the next few weeks.  

The meeting with Arend went very well.  He and his assistant, Ariana, were super excited to help out and offered a lot of resources for reaching out to people, both locally and online.  I we can provide them with good content, they might be able to make Diana go viral.  

I spent the rest of the day researching for Arend's video and answering policy oriented questions from "Local Bernicrats," a group that approves candidates who are politically aligned with many of the interests of Bernie Sanders.  They then provide suggestions to Bernie supporters as to who they should be voting for down the ballot.


### Thursday, January 9
Today was the day of the actual climate rally in front of the Capitol.  Governor Jared Polis was delivering his State of the State address to the legislature at 11:00am, so the activists, led by members of the Sunrise Movement, Colorado Rising, and Extinction Rebellion assembled outside at 9:30 to begin their protest.  We stayed for about an hour, taking pictures with the group leaders and sizing up the scene.  Diana had a speaking engagement midway through the planned protest, so we left early.  On our way home, I submitted a sample of our petitioning form to the Secretary of State's office for approval.  Later in the day, we heard that protesters had moved inside the Statehouse and been arrested for disrupting the Governor's speech.  Thirty protesters were arrested, and each held with a $1,000 bail. 

When we got back to the headquarters, I began emailing various student groups on college campuses around the state, especially those that represented liberal population pockets in generally conservative congressional districts, to gather their support and access their networks to gain potential volunteers to help us canvas in those areas.  I drafted a standardized email to send to groups like these, and customized if to send out to each individual group.  Afterwards, I created a Facebook post that included our volunteer sign-up form that we could post in various private Facebook groups that Diana was a member of.  

### Wednesday, January 8
Wednesday was the first day of the 2020 Spring legislative session.  Diana believed there would be a climate protest in front of the Capitol building that morning, so we went to join in which the action groups that were planning to attend.  The protest was actually scheduled for the next day, but there were still many groups outside the Capital.  We spoke to a number of them and listened to the reasons that they were protesting.  By the time we left, many were interested in Diana's candidacy and platform.  

When we returned to the campaign headquarters, I prepared a series of Facebook posts aimed at gathering information from potential volunteers. I worked with Diana to hone in the best possible language for the posts, and published them.  
Following that, I researched existing events that would be happening during the petition gathering period, to which we could send volunteers to collect signatures from the attendees, trying to find things hosted by organizations aligned with Diana's platform and likely to attract registered Democrats.

### Tuesday, January 7
We began the day creating social media content that could be posted throughout the day.  That morning, Colorado Rising, a statewide anti-fracking group, had released 6 potential ballot initiative that would limit fracking across the state.  Diana was heavily involved in the decade long fight to limit fracking in Colorado, so much of the social media content was oriented around connecting Diana to that initiative.  

The rest of the day was spent researching the areas of each Congressional District that have high concentrations of registered Democrats, where we should be focusing our petitioning efforts.  

That night I staffed for Diana at a meeting of the Aurora County Democrats.  She was invited to speak along with another Senate candidate.  Upon arrival, we began networking with the Party members and getting sign-ups for the mailing list.  While Diana was speaking, we circulated around the room, getting pictures of her addressing the crowd.  

### Monday, January 6th
We began work at 12:00pm, a late start because the morning was spend cleaning up from the event the night before.  The day began with formal introductions between ourselves, Diana, and her Campaign Manager Lauren.  Introductions were followed by a briefing on the campaign's current situation and our overarching goals, and our tasks for the next few days. 

The next 2 hours were spent sending out thank you notes to donors and acquainting ourselves with the social media accounts that the campaign is using for outreach and publicity.  From there, we created content to be posted across all forms of social media that day.  

I researched various mass texting platforms that the campaign could use to contact and coordinate volunteers and potential petition signers.  Since the campaign does not have a huge fundraising apparatus, we have to focus on using alternative options for solving problems that larger campaigns can pay to solve. 

### Sunday, January 5
I arrived in Denver last week to move into where we would be staying for the duration of the internship.  We were slated to begin work on Monday, January 6th, but Diana was hosting a campaign function at her house on Sunday, so we got right into the thick of things.  

The event was styled as a holiday party for family, friends, and neighbors.  While the event was clearly connected with her Senate campaign, Diana is somewhat against hardcore politicing and wanted instead to provide a space in which people could come together over their individual issues.  She invited multiple other Democrats running for Office in 2020, both from other races and her own, and gave each time to speak.  Chris, the other intern from Middlebury, and I were tasked with welcoming the guests and facilitating the logistical side of the party.  The house has a pizza oven in the living room, so we had to help everyone make their own pizza.  This allowed me to meet a ton of different people as they each came through the kitchen.  While it was not fashioned as a fundraiser, the event still brought in donations from many who attended, and was a great opportunity to orient myself in the landscape of local Denver and Colorado politics.
